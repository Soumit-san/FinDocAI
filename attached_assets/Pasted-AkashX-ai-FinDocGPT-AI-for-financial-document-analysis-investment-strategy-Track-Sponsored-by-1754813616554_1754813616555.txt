Track: Sponsored by AkashX.ai (logo: )
1. Introduction
This challenge invites you to build an AI-powered tool that can transform how financial data is analyzed, predicted, and used for real-time investment decisions. Your goal is to create a solution that processes financial reports, forecasts market trends, and generates actionable buy/sell recommendations based on the predictions.
The Vision:
 Create an AI system that:
Provides deep insights into financial reports.


Predicts market trends.


Formulates investment strategies for real-time decision-making.
2. Challenge Breakdown – Think in 3 Stages
Stage 1: Insights & Analysis (Document Q&A)
Develop a system to process financial documents (earnings reports, filings, press releases) and extract key insights.
 Primary Objectives:
Document Q&A: Answer questions based on financial data (e.g., What is the company’s revenue for the quarter? What are the key risks?)


Market Sentiment Analysis: Quantify sentiment from financial communications (positive, negative, neutral).


Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual changes in financial metrics that may signal risks.


Stage 2: Financial Forecasting
Integrate forecasting capabilities to predict future financial outcomes based on historical data.
 Primary Objectives:
Predict Financial Trends: Forecast stock prices, earnings growth, and market performance.


External Data Integration: Enhance predictions with data from Yahoo Finance API, Quandl, or Alpha Vantage.


Forecasting Models: Build models to predict stock movements, earnings, or market risks.


Stage 3: Investment Strategy & Decision-Making
Using insights from Stage 1 and Stage 2, develop an investment strategy to recommend buy/sell actions.
 Primary Objectives:
Investment Decision-Making: Based on predictions, recommend whether to Buy or Sell a stock.


Strategic Decision Support: Use financial data, market sentiment, and forecasts to build clear investment recommendations.


3. Dataset Details
The FinanceBench dataset includes:
Earnings Reports: Financial documents with revenue, profit, expenses, etc.


Market Data: Historical stock prices, trading volume, and financial indicators.


Sentiment Data: Text data from earnings calls, press releases, and news articles.


Example:
Earnings Reports: Includes fields like quarterly revenue, net profit, and expenses. The goal is to predict the company’s next quarter performance.


Market Data: Includes stock price history and trends used for forecasting.


Sentiment Data: Articles or transcripts reflecting market sentiment about a company or industry.


4. Technical Requirements
FinanceBench Dataset Integration: Use and integrate the FinanceBench dataset throughout all stages of the challenge.


AI/ML Models: Implement models for text analysis, financial forecasting, and decision-making.


Real-Time Processing & Visualization: Build a web-based application for real-time querying, with interactive visualizations (graphs, charts) to present predictions and insights.


5. Evaluation Criteria
Submissions will be evaluated on: Please define and report clear benchmarking metrics
Accuracy of Predictions: How well does the model forecast financial trends?


Effectiveness of Q&A: How accurately can the system answer financial questions?


Investment Strategy: How well does the model recommend buy/sell actions based on predictions?


User Interface: The usability and clarity of the web interface.


Innovation: Creativity in combining financial analysis and strategy development.


6. Why This Challenge Matters
